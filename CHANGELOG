Changelog
=========

This changelog is inspired by https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/[Keep a
Changelog]. We follow https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[semver], but since
we're in 0.x it's a lawless land anyway.

+mumctl+ and +mumd+ will follow the same version numberings at least through
0.x, which we will revisit following 1.0.

Points under "unreleased" currently exist on main and will be part of the next
release. Generally, if it's relevant, you should add a line here when creating
a PR.
