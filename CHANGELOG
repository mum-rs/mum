Changelog
=========

This changelog is inspired by https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/[Keep a
Changelog]. We follow https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[semver], but since
we're in 0.x it's a lawless land anyway.

Points under "unreleased" currently exist on main and will be part of the next
release.
