Unreleased
----------

- Instead of four crates we now have only two. mumd and mumctl were merged into
  mum as binary targets.
- You can now disable the noise gate by setting `disable_noise_gate = true`
  under `[audio]` in the configuration file.

0.4.0 - 2021-06-19
------------------

Major changes:

- Added a noise gate.
- Added support for server passwords. Thanks @rbran!
- Added support for sending and receiving text messages.
- See a list of occured events (connections, messages, mute/deafen, ...) with
  "mumctl events".
- Invalid server certificates are rejected by default and need to be
  explicitly allowed either when connecting or permanently per server or
  globally.
- .ogg sound effects.

Other:

- Added tunneling audio through TCP if UDP connection goes down.
- --version now includes the current commit hash.
- Changed how you mute yourself/others. See manpages for details on the new options.
- The current channel status is now printed when connecting to a server.
- Client no longer sends empty audio packets.
- Informative error message instead of panic when a running mumd-process can't
  be found.
- Lots of other minor informative error messages instead of panics.
- Status requests are sent in parallel.
- Pings are less spammy in the log output.
- Sound output is stereo by default.
- Updated to tokio 1.0.
- Cleaned up dependencies

0.3.1 - 2021-04-08
------------------

- Compilation no longer fails with "module export is private".

0.3.0 - 2020-12-25
------------------

Major changes:

- Published to crates.io. You can now install with "cargo install {mumctl,mumd}"!
- Support for macOS.
- Notifications via libnotify (behind a feature-gate).
- List configured servers, if they're online, and how many users are
  connected with "mumctl status".
- Configure your own outgoing volume and others' ingoing volume with "mumctl config".
- Mute/deafen yourself with "mumctl {mute,deafen}".
- Locally mute others with "mumctl user <user> mute".
- Sound effects.
- Connecting and disconnecting from servers is now done with "mumctl
  {connect,disconnect}" instead of under the "server" subcommand.

Other:

- Manpages.
- Short about-texts when using "--help".
- Starting an instance of mumd while another is already running now requires the
  old instance to be shut down so instances aren't left running and unreachable.
- Moved to dasp, a pure Rust digital audio signal processing library.

0.2.0 - 2020-10-26
------------------

- Connect to and disconnect from servers with "mumctl server
  {connect,disconnect}".
- Save and reconfigure servers with "mumctl server {add,remove,rename,config}".
- List channels and connect to them with "mumctl channel {list,join}".
- Store configuration in a file.
- Generate CLI completions for zsh, bash and fish with "mumctl completions --{zsh,bash,fish}".
